Hello There,

While I am writing this I think I should share that I am 100% caffeinated, consider this the **FULL DISCLOSURE!!!**

So let me start with a quick introduction. My name is Diego S. Yanez. I currently recide in NYC and working out of a WeWork Hot Desk in MidTown. 

I moved to NYC almost 6 years ago from Miami FL. I had some friends from FL that lived here already so I immediately got in touch with them to meet up. That is when I first got introduced to coding. They would sometimes talk about C++, JavaScript, etc... I was just facinated by the whole subject. I didn't really understand what they where talking about so I asked a lot of questions.

Moving on. After a couple of failed attempts of trying to code myself while learning at CodeCademy, I never fully commited. I knew that it was never going to be the perfect situation for me to fully commit. 

 Until one morning my boss told me that I was about to have my one year anniversary (March29th) in a job that I told myself that it would be temporary. I felt so depressed. I knew it was time for me to change, adapt, and challenge myself again. 
 
 So here I am.
